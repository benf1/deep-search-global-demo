{"text": "Good evening and welcome to Deep Search.\nThat was Charles Aznavour singing \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nYou can probably guess why I opened the show with that.\nI think many of you already know, but tonight, exactly at midnight, we cross into February 1st,\nand me, right there, I go over the other side of the mountain.\nI turn sixty.\n\nYeah, the big six-oh.\nThe kind of thing that stings your eyes a little, if we're honest.\n\nSo tonight, this is a special broadcast.\nThat's why we shifted the show to this late slot.\nSince it's my birthday, and not just any birthday, I had to mark the moment and offer you a different kind of show.\n\nIn 1966, Johnny was singing \"Black Is Black.\"\nHendrix was singing \"Hey Joe.\"\nNancy Sinatra was singing \"Bang Bang.\"\nAnd Carla Thomas was singing this one.\nCarla Thomas was singing \"Baby.\"\n\nI arrived in 1966.\nSo opening with a track from '66 called \"Baby\" just makes sense.\n\nTonight, we're going to hear a lot of music.\nA lot, a lot, truly a lot.\nWith the playlist I've built for you, we're spending the whole night together.\nYes, you heard me right.\nI'm playing music for you all the way until sunrise.\n\nWe're going to travel back through time, musically, from 1966 to 2026.\nEvery track I picked resonates with me in a very personal way.\nYou never really know why one song marks you more than another,\nbut tonight I'm taking the chance to play only the records that I absolutely love.\n\nAnd because music has that power to call back memories of a moment, a place, or a person,\ntonight I'll play music all night and tell you stories.\nThe magic of songs that touch us lets our adventures stay printed in memory forever.\nAnd of course, given my path, many of my memories are tied to one place that means the world to me:\nthe dance floor.\n", "model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2", "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.26, "similarity_boost": 0.95, "style": 0.6, "use_speaker_boost": true}}
